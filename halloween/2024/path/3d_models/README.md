# 3D Models for the skull jars

The original skull jars were purchased from [Hobbyraft](https://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/)
for around Â£2 each and have a mason jar typescrew lid. They are green but we also got
some orange ones. Here is a [link](https://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/light-green-skull-drinking-jar-/6701041003.html).

## Skull jar lids

To make the skulls more waterproof and the fittings just generally better, I bought
a fairly basic 3D Printer ([Creality Ender V3 SE](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-ender-3-v3-se)).

I started with searching on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) and found the
model [Mason Jar Straw Lid by QWERTZ](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4432681). I
used that as the basis of my work.

The first change I made was to increase the diameter of the straw hole to 12 mm to
allow me to fit the [12mm cable glands](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07JH2LPZF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) that will be used to route the 3-core
cable through the top.

## Neopixel ring clip

In the lid of the skull jars there will be a [32mm Neopixel ring](https://coolcomponents.co.uk/products/8-led-32mm-ring-ws2812b-5050-rgb-led-with-integrated-drivers-adafruit-neopixel-compatible) containing 8 lovely bright Neopixel compatible LEDs which I purchased from the amazing [Cool Components](https://coolcomponents.co.uk/). To be able to mount the Neopixel ring neatly in the top, I designed a simple
Neopixel clip in two variants, normal and taller. The normal clip gives a nice flush tight finish but
is a bit fiddly to get in. The taller one allows more movement and is simpler.

## Attaching the Neopixel rings to the jar lid

Holding the Neopixel ring clip in place required another clip that went from
