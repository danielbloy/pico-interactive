# 3D Models for the Skull jars

The original skull jars were purchased from [Hobbyraft](https://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/)
for around Â£2 each and have a mason jar typescrew lid. They are green but we also got
some orange ones. Here is a [link](https://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/light-green-skull-drinking-jar-/6701041003.html).

To make the skulls more waterproof and the fittings just generally better, I bought
a fairly basic 3D Printer ([Creality Ender V3 SE](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-ender-3-v3-se)).

I started with searching on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) and found the
model [Mason Jar Straw Lid by QWERTZ](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4432681). I
used that as the basis of my work.

The first change I made was to increase the diameter of the straw hole to 12 mm.
