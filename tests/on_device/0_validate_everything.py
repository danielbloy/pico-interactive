# This script is designed to be run on the device and tests all functionality
# to ensure compatibility. This is designed to be run on a board that has
# a button, buzzer, LEDs, NeoPixels and Wifi. It does test the ultrasonic
#
# Each item is done once at a time in the following order with each section
# taking a small amount of time (RAM details will be output at each point and
# the logger functionality will be used throughout):
# 1. TODO: Runner with Wifi, send and receive messages (including directory?)
# 2. TODO: Runner with button and buzzer (melodies)
# 3. TODO: Runner with LEDs, NeoPixels and animations
# 4. TODO: Runner with audio (mps) through buzzer
# 5. TODO: Runner with ultrasonic sensor
# 6. TODO: Interactive framework (limited in functionality to conserve RAM).
