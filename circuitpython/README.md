# CircuitPython

This directory contains a copy of all the CircuitPython images and libraries that
this project is tested against and supports. Currently, the project is being built
against:

* CircuitPython 9.0.5 - confirmed
* CircuitPython 9.1.2 - testing in progress
* CircuitPython 9.2.0 - future

The CircuitPython libraries that are required for the project have been extracted
out into the `lib` directory for easy access.
