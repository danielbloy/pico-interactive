## Roadmap

Below you will find the proposed roadmap of functionality that I am planning to build into
the `pico-interactive``project. This is all subject to change as project priorities may
require different functionality sooner. No timelines are provided.

Throughout all releases work will continue to add the additional test support that was missing
from the libraries that were migrated but had no tests.

* Fix issue with `5_validate_interactive.py` defaulting to using an Ultrasonic sensor on demo board.
* Support using board.LED for an LED in tests (so it works with Pico 2 W)
* Add support for communications between Picos using UART and possible 1-wire support.
* Examples should include some using 3.5mm jack breakouts to connect devices.
* Examples with support for Servos required for the Inventor/Lego Car projects for Code Club.
* Examples with I2S audio support in addition to the existing PWM.
* Examples with motor support.
* Examples with DFPlayer support.
